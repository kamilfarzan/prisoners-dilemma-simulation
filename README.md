Tested locally only. May be unstable.

This program takes strategies from the directory of strategies/p[1,2]s and puts them in p1.py and p2.py accordingly.
Then it runs eval_engine.py, measures and record the outputs.
Finally, it gives the leaderboard of the tournament.

```bash
python run_tournament.py
